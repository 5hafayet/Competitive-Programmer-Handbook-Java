## Introduction

The "Competitive Programmers Handbook" is a valuable resource for aspiring competitive programmers who want to enhance their problem-solving skills and improve their understanding of algorithms. This repository serves as a companion to the book, providing Java implementations of the algorithms discussed, along with additional notes and explanations.

## Algorithms

This section contains Java code examples and explanations for various algorithms covered in the book, including:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search, depth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm)
- Dynamic programming algorithms (e.g., Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem)
- Greedy algorithms
- Number theory algorithms (e.g., prime numbers, modular arithmetic)
- Geometry algorithms
- And more...

Each algorithm is organized in its respective directory within the repository. Feel free to navigate through the folders and review the code and accompanying explanations.

## Usage

You are welcome to explore the code examples and notes in this repository. To run the code examples, make sure you have Java installed on your system. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler and execute the compiled program to observe the algorithms in action.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have any improvements, additional code examples, or notes related to the algorithms covered in the book, feel free to submit a pull request. Please follow the guidelines outlined in the repository's `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
